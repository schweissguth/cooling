<h1>3.5kW DX Split</h1>
<div id="div">
<ul>
		<li>Value Proposition<ul>
			<li><em>The Uniflair RM 3.5kW is a DX split cooling 
								system.&nbsp; In additional to all the Uniflair RM 
								cooling benefits, the DX split keeps U-space 
								consumption small by splitting it up into 
								internal and external pieces – which means this 
								system is designed to be room neutral i.e. the 
								heat pulled from the rack is not rejected into 
								the IT space.&nbsp; This keeps the rack temperature 
								consistent and stable.</em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Benefits<ul>
			<li>Cools virtually any rack up to 3.5kW<ul>
				<li>enough cooling to cool most single racks</li>
				<li>no need for overprovisioned room based cooling 
							(reduced cost, complexity, etc)</li>
				<li>can also be used to introduce stability in 
							environments with existing, unstable cooling</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Only 5U height<ul>
				<li>fits discretely inside rack therefore no need to 
							deploy external cooling</li>
				<li>Higher cooling output in a smaller size because 
							positioning is closest to the source; also greatly 
							improves predictability</li>
				<li>room neutral so therefore integration-friendly and 
							closely positioned to IT equip for maximum 
							predictability and smallest form factor &gt;&gt;can also 
							serve as primary cooling in a room with</li>
				<li>commercial 
							cooling to prevent heat build up when building HVAC 
							turns off for the weekend.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Bottom mounted<ul>
				<li>placed in bottom of rack to ensure maximum available 
							and accessible U space</li>
				<li>discretely placed to maximize integration potential</li>
				<li>easily positioned into place and transportable with 
							rack</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Room-neutral (DX split)<ul>
				<li>the DX split system is designed to be room-neutral, 
							which means the heat is fully rejected to the 
							outdoors and therefore entirely self-sufficient 
							(i.e. not self-contained) &gt;&gt;this does require</li>
				<li>however mechanical piping between the indoor and 
							outdoor pcs</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Flexible for customer "self-contained“ configuration<ul>
				<li>to simplify installation, the condensing unit can 
							be installed on top of the rack or adjacent to the 
							rack so that the system essentially becomes 
							self-contained. This way the system provides</li>
				<li>point-cooling inside the rack while rejecting the 
							heat outside of it. For this to work, the room in 
							which the rack is placed must be large enough to 
							absorb the heat or there must be sufficient</li>
				<li>ventilation to manage it. </li>
			</ul>
